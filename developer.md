The open data being gathered by OpenActive and associated partners will transform the sport and physical sector. We’ve made it easy for developers to understand and engage with our data standards and the Opportunity Data Dashboard, to ensure relevant organisations nationwide can join us in revolutionising the way people find, access, and participate in new activities.

### Opportunity Data Dashboard
The Opportunity Data Dashboard lists all of the opportunity data feeds we have currently available. Because no single platform or app holds all the data available under OpenActive, we’ve designed the first set of OpenActive standards to support developers in harvesting and collecting data from multiple sources.

Explore the dashboard to find the data you need, identify which feeds conform to our standards, and provide feedback to publishers.
