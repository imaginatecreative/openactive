 The OpenActive Accelerator establishes ready-to-market startups using open data to develop digital products and services that help people get active. 
 
The accelerator provides training, mentorship, access to funding and perks within the ODI, Sport England and external partner networks. It also gives access to open data about physical activity opportunities made open for the first time by OpenActive members such as Greenwich Leisure Limited, Lawn Tennis Association and British Cycling.
