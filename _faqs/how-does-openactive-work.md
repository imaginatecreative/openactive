By:

* Improving access to opportunity data – making data about where and when sport and physical activities happen open for anyone to access, use and share so that more places, products and services can better inform people of opportunities to get active.
 
* Stimulating innovation with data to help meet people’s digital expectations – by stimulating innovation with open opportunity data, and creating products and services that use this data, in order to help people make better choices to get active and transform the way people discover and participate in relevant activities.

* Developing open standards – in collaboration with the sector so that data about sport and physical activity opportunities is consistently described, categorised and structured. These standards aim to maximise use and compatibility for new tools, products and services designed to get people active.

* Building data literacy within the sector – by championing data leadership, inspiring transformation and change across organisations, and strengthening the practical capability of sport and physical activity organisations to work with open data

* Working collaboratively to evoke change across the sector – for a digitally-driven and better-connected future in the sector enabled by better data sharing and access to open opportunity data. Including establishing a sense of shared ownership within the sector to ensure the OpenActive initiative is self-governing and truly sustainable.
