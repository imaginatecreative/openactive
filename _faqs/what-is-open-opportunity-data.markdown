 ‘Open opportunity data’ is data about where and when sport and physical activities happen – for example: when a yoga class is, a boxing class age restriction, a tennis court hire cost, where a group run is taking place.

The data is openly available for anyone to access, use and share, with an open license. It does not include personal data about customers, or commercially restricted data.
