OpenActive is a community-led initiative across the sport and physical activity sector. This means every OpenActive member – open to join – plays a part in progressing its vision “using data to help people get active” and shares ownership of its progress and achievements.

There’s a diverse range of organisations and people in the OpenActive community growing each month. From, influential bodies such as National Governing Bodies, County Sports Partnerships and local councils, large activity providers like leisure operators, individual groups like outdoor fitness classes, data service providers like platforms and booking systems, individual advocates, mass participation event providers and more. You can browse the full [list of members](  {{ site.baseurl }}{% link members-page.md %}  ).

Through lottery funding awarded by Sport England, the Open Data Institute stewards the initiative, driving engagement across the sector, building data literacy, collaboratively developing open data standards, stimulating innovation with startups and leading the initiative’s events and communications. The current funding phase is between November 2017 - November 2018.
