Before the OpenActive Accelerator begins on 1st May 2018, weâ€™ll agree on a work plan. The agreement between each startup and OpenActive includes milestones and success criteria, as well as a review plan. The applicant must provide the documentation required to finalise acceptance onto the programme and return a signed contract by the required date. A detailed schedule will be sent out in due time.

Startups will be mentored by OpenActive partners and external advisers in addition to the support from the ODI and Sport England. During the six months, the applicant will be asked to provide regular updates on their progress. In particular, they will be invited to attend specific events, as well as one or two review meetings (in-person) at key milestones in their project.
