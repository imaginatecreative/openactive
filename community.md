### OpenActive standards group

Our goal is to develop technical specifications and best practices that support the use of open and shared data about sports and physical activities.

While our work is technical, you don’t have to be a developer to contribute. Our primary focus is standardising how to publish data about physical activity opportunities, defining best practices and APIs to enable booking events and facilities, and improving interoperability of data across the sector.
